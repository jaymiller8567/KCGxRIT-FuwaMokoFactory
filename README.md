# FuwaMoko Factory
Game Jam project created during RIT x KCG Game Jam over May 23-25th 2025 in Kyoto, Japan!

***Software & Languages Utilized: Unity 2D, C#, Adobe Photoshop*** 

## Game Jam Details:
- 72-hour game jam in person with students from Kyoto Computer Gakuin (JP: 京都コンピュータ学院).
- Each team had about 3 students from RIT and 4 students from KCG.
- The theme of the game jam was "kawaii".

> Creating FuwaMoko Factory was a familiar process with unique challenges- largely that most of us from RIT knew little to no Japanese (and even if they did, like me, it was more basic conversation and not related to game development). After we finished our game, we all presented our projects in a lecture hall. Presenting our group's work at the end of the long weekend for the other students and staff was honestly my favorite part!


## FuwaMoko Factory Details:
FuwaMoko Factory (JP: ふわふわもこもこ) is an arcade-style game where you sort plushies into the correct boxes depending on their characteristics. Play as tigers who work at the "FuwaMoko" factory- two words in Japanese meaning "fluffy" and "fuzzy" respectively. Sort the plushies between fluffy (fuwa) and moko (fuzzy) and avoid the spikes as they move across the conveyer belt! 


## Game Jam Contributions:
- Led team of 8 Japanese and American students, focusing on vertical slice production model while navigating language barriers by utilizing translation tools.
- Helped formulate the game's visual identity by creating logos and unique character animation.
- Developed UI and easy-to-navigate menus
